# dotfiles
A few dotfiles that I made

Will update them over time, but for now I like these.

Using this in my startup scripts is nice too.


At some point, this repo will get cleaned up so if other people want to use all this stuff, they can do so without having a ridiculous amount of crap laying around.

For now, stick with just the install.sh script to do a bit.

This is eventually going to get Dockerized and compatible with any environment, but still will be all the things that only I like.

```
git clone git@github.com:ChampokDas/dotfiles.git

cd dotfiles/

./install.sh
```
